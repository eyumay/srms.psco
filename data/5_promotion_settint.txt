Things to consider while performing promotion
0. mark current program_section status to inactive, so selection of active classes should be possible
1. Promote students only with WARNING and PASS status
2. Find class current year and semester, and define where to promote i.e, next year and semester
3. create section to enroll students to
4. 
. Keep current semester results    
## Current semester
    - semester_chr
    - semester_grade_points
    - semester_repeated_chrs
    - semester_repeated_grade_points
    - total_chrs                    = total_chrs+semester_chrs
    - total_grade_points            = total_grade_points + semester_grade_points
    - total_repeated_chrs           = total_repeated_chrs + semester_repeated_chrs
    - total_repeated_grade_points   = total_repeated_grade_points + semester_repeated_grade_points
## Following semester 
  As
    - previous_chrs                     = semester_chrs
    - previous_grade_points             = semester_grade_points
    - previous_repeated_chrs            = semester_repeated_chrs
    - previous_repeated_grade_points    = semester_repeated_chrs

    i.e,
    copy semester_chr -> previous_chr


#Promotion setting:
- section_id
- current_academic_year
- current_year
- current_semester
- to_progam_id
- to_section_id
- to_academic_year
- to_year
- to_semester
  - academic_calendar,
- pass_point

Today TODO
** Create promotion setting should be administrative action
** Create Promotion Setting -> link should be visible to only admin, and on ProgramSection > Sectiondetail action

1. Create one section after database reset and test the promotion setting
   - Also define __toString() method for ProgramSection
2. Promotion setting should only be displayed to data workers department specific, IT should not see Law promotion setting.
   - ProgramSection field at PromotionSetting should display department specific
3. ON CREATE NEW PROMOTION SETTING
    - This page should only be accessed from SECTIONDETAIL page so
        -> current academic year (from session)
        -> current year(from session)
        -> current semester(from session)
        -> section_id(from session)
   Now the form should display fields only where to promote 
    - to year
    - to semester
    - pass point
